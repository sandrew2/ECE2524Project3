# ECE2524Project3
ECE 2524 Python Group Project: By, Anthony Clifton, Andrew Shivers, and Adam Donovan
This project acts as a mini-game selector. You start out at a welcome screen that then transitions
to the main menu. From the main menu you can select 1 of 3 games. All the games close the main menu
when the game launches. Mastermind and Hangman open in new GUI windows to play, while Tic-Tac-Toe runs
from the command line. To pick a new game you must relaunch the main menu GUI.

To play the games you must download Python 2.7 and download all of the files in the GIT to a single folder.
Then run the GUI.py file to start the games system which will bring you to the start screen.
